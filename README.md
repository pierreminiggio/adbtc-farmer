# adbtc-farmer

Requirements :
- NodeJS
- 2Captcha Token (https://2captcha.com/support/faq/63) - Warning : you need to pay to use their API
- Knowing your adbtc login and password

Installing :
```console
git clone https://github.com/pierreminiggio/adbtc-farmer
cd adbtc-farmer
npm i
cp ids_example.json ids.json
```

Fill the ids.json file with your infos

Running :
```console
npm start
```
Try at your own risk, in my experience at the time I typed this code, the 2Captcha fee is greater than the crypto gain. So it might not be worth it.
